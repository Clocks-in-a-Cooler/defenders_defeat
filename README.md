## Defender's Defeat

A game where _you're_ the attacker!

## Important!

This is the `stable` branch. Features that work and won't crash the game are pushed here from `development`.

If you're impatient and what to see what it's like, simply clone/download the repo and open `index.html`. I know having tens of kilobytes of Javascript is a bad idea &mdash; if this game does get released, I'll make sure to minify everything.
