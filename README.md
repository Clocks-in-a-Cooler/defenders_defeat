## Defender's Defeat

A game where _you're_ the attacker!

## Important!

Right now, the game undergoing development. This branch is not stable and will probably crash at the worst possible time. If you can, you should use `stable` branch instead.

If you're impatient and what to see what it's like, simply clone/download the repo and open `index.html`. I know having tens of kilobytes of Javascript is a bad idea &mdash; if this game does get released, I'll make sure to minify everything.
